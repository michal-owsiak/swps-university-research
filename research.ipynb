    "# **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Studies have consistently shown that controlled psychedelic use and mystical experiences can produce positive outcomes such as increased life satisfaction, enhanced empathy, and reduced fear of death. However, despite the extensive research, there still remain gaps in the available data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Aims:** The study tested whether individuals who (H1) use psychedelics or (H2) have had a complete mystical experience exhibit (1) higher life satisfaction and (2) greater emotional empathy, along with (3) lower fear of death. It also examined if (H3) a complete mystical experience provides a better explanation for the outcomes compared to psychedelic use alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** An online survey that included questions about psychedelic use and questionnaires measuring mystical experiences, fear of death, emotional empathy, and life satisfaction. A sample of 686 subjects was analyzed using two-way ANOVA and linear regression modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** Complete mystical experiences were significantly linked with lower fear of death, higher life satisfaction, and greater overall and positive-emotional empathy. Psychedelic users exhibited fear of death lower than non-users, with no significant effects on overall emotional empathy or life satisfaction. The users group also demonstrated significantly lower negative-emotional empathy than non-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:** While causal inference cannot be drawn from this study, it suggests that mystical experiences, regardless of their trigger, may potentially mitigate death anxiety, enhance life satisfaction, and foster a greater inclination to share positive emotions with others.\n",

    "# **1. Brief introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychedelic substances, such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, or mescaline, are known for their ability to induce cognitively and emotionally intense sensations, sometimes described by individuals as personal breakthroughs. Other circumstances known to potentially induce very similar experiences are: temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly in the rare ecstatic subtype; strokes or mechanical damage to the frontal and temporal areas of the brain; clinical death; prolonged exposure to high altitudes, especially in combination with social isolation and/or stress (e.g., during mountain climbing); breathing techniques such as holotropic breathing; sensory deprivation; sleep deprivation; lucid dreaming; intense stress or trauma; intense physical exertion; and profound experiences with works of art. These experiences are often described as transcending the familiar categories of time, space, logic, and one's own identity accompanied by a profound sense of awe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern trends in recent decades have shifted the study of mystical experiences from the fields of philosophy and religious studies to psychopharmacology, neuroscience, and other empirical disciplines. This shift has resulted in the development of more precise methods for studying these occurrences. Based on existing literature, this study aims to verify the associations of mystical experiences and psychedelic use with fear of death, emotional empathy, and life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is arguably the first to measure these variables in the context of psychedelic use and mystical experiences within a Polish research sample. The information it yields may indirectly contribute to the debate on the extent to which the therapeutic potential of psychedelics is dependent on the subjective effects they produce. Additionally, it expands the cultural contexts of mystical experiences research."

    "# **2. Data collection & dataset overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start wrangling, cleaning, and analyzing the data, it's essential to understand what we are working with. Here is some vital information about our dataset and the data collection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using [Qualtrics XM](https://www.qualtrics.com/), the online survey was created and distributed through various social media channels. Recruitment for the research was open from February 17, 2023, to March 29, 2023. The distributed survey consisted of the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Homepage**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Participants were informed about the study conditions, a general outline of their participation, and an estimate of its duration. The introduction mentioned that certain parts of the survey might cause some emotional discomfort. It was stated that complete anonymity would be ensured and participants could withdraw from the study at any time. Clicking the \"Proceed\" button at the bottom of the page indicated consent to participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographic metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Basic demographic data of participants were collected: age, gender, level of education, and worldview on spiritual matters. In this section, participants were also asked about their preferred survey version – masculine or feminine. Based on their choice, subsequent content was presented using either masculine or feminine forms of verbs and adjectives (Polish language).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Meditation/mindfulness practice**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Participants were asked if they practice meditation/mindfulness. If they did, they were asked to estimate the number of minutes devoted to this practice in the last 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Psychedelics use**\n",
    "\n",
    "  A multiple-choice list was presented for participants to mark the psychedelic compounds they had used at least once in their lives, with an option to add other substances. The list included: LSD (or 1P-LSD); psilocybin mushrooms (or synthetic psilocybin); ayahuasca; DMT (other than ayahuasca); 5-MeO-DMT; mescaline; ibogaine; salvia divinorum.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Those who selected at least one substance were asked to estimate how many times they had used psychedelics and the subjective doses (microdoses, low, average, high, very high). Salvia divinorum and ibogaine were eventually excluded from the psychedelics group as they do not meet the criteria (affinity with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors) for classic psychedelics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mystical experiences**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Participants were asked if they had experienced a state of consciousness characterized by: **(1)** an altered sense of time and/or space, **(2)** a sense of awe, wonder, or fear, **(3)** ineffability, and **(4)** subjective transcendental/mystical qualities. Negative responses skipped subsequent items and the entire Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30), proceeding directly to dependent variable questionnaires.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Affirmative responses led to a multiple-choice list to select the circumstances of the experience. If involving a psychedelic substance, they specified which of the compounds triggered the most intense experience. Multiple circumstances required specification of the first and most intense experience. The last item estimated how long ago the most intense experience occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  This questionnaire, consisting of 30 items, measures the intensity of mystical experiences (MacLean et al., 2012; Barrett et al., 2015). Based on Walter Stace's classic concept (1960/1973), four dimensions are measured: *Mysticism*, *Positive Affect*, *Transcendence of Time and Space*, and *Ineffability*. Participants rated their experience on a 6-point Likert scale. The Polish translation (α = 0.95, N = 515) by the research author was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Confirmatory factor analysis showed a structural difference from the original. The item \"Experience of amazement\" loaded onto the *Ineffability* dimension rather than *Positive Affect*. However, retaining the original structure preserved slightly better reliability (α<sub>mysticism</sub> = 0.95; α<sub>positive affect</sub> = 0.80; α<sub>transcendence</sub> = 0.85; α<sub>ineffability</sub> = 0.79).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Perth Empathy Scale (PES)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  This tool measures cognitive and affective empathy (Brett et al., 2022), categorized into positive and negative emotions, forming four subscales. The study used the *Positive* and *Negative Affective Empathy* subscales (α<sub>positive-affective</sub> = 0.70; α<sub>negative-affective</sub> = 0.72, N = 676), contributing to *Overall Affective Empathy* (α = 0.73; 10 items). Each item followed a structured format with responses on a 5-point Likert scale. The Polish version by Paweł Larionow and Karolina Mudło-Głagolska (2022) was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  Created by Ed Diener and colleagues (1985), this scale has 5 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale. It measures life satisfaction (example item: *If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing*). The Polish translation by Konrad Jankowski (2015) was used (α = 0.86, N = 676).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Death Attitude Profile - Revised (DAP-R-PL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  This tool measures five areas of attitudes toward death, including types of death acceptance and avoidance, and fear of death (Wong et al., 1994). Only the *Fear of Death* subscale was used (example item: *Death is undoubtedly an unpleasant experience*) in the Polish adaptation by Paweł Brudek et al. (2020). This subscale has 10 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale (α = 0.92, N = 676).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subjectively perceived influence**\n",
    "\n",
    "  This section was for participants who reported undergoing a mystical experience. They answered three questions about the impact of the experience on empathy, life satisfaction, and fear of death, rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Participants could also share their experience in an optional text field."

However, what about the NaN values appearing even when participants have completed 100% of the survey? Again, this is a result of the survey's interactive nature. Besides splitting the questionnaires into two gender-specific forms, certain sections were hidden based on participants' responses. For instance, if a participant indicated never having used a psychedelic compound, the section asking about dosage wouldn't appear, leading to NaN values. The same scenario applies to questions about meditation time and those specific to mystical experiences. Also, unchecked boxes on the lists were automatically exported as *Not a Number*."

    "During the research design phase, it was determined to exclude outliers that fall outside `2.5` standard deviations (*SD*) from the mean scores of dependent variables. This approach aims to enhance the likelihood of obtaining normally distributed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we need to calculate the *Z-scores* for each record. The *Z-score* indicates how many *SD* a particular data point deviates from the mean score. Here is the formula for calculating it:\n",

    "***μ*** - the mean score of the data,\n",
    "\n",
    "***σ*** - the *SD* value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply this formula to our dependent variables and create new columns to store these calculated *Z-scores*. Since the *Z-score* only reflects the magnitude of deviation from the mean, without indicating direction (above or below), we will use the NumPy function `abs` to obtain absolute (positive) values of the scores."

    "Upon analysis, the *p*-value for the change in predictive power of the model was found to be statistically significant when incorporating information about the presence or absence of a complete mystical experience for each dependent variable. However, it is noteworthy that the *R<sup>2</sup>* values remained quite low for emotional empathy (1%) and life satisfaction (2%). In contrast, the Model 2 was able to explain 11% of the observed variance in fear of death. Nevertheless, we have to accept our `H3` hypothesis as valid."

    "**Mystical experiences are related to fear of death, empathy, and life satisfaction levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "People with a complete mystical experience are characterized by significantly lower fear of death, significantly higher emotional empathy, and significantly higher life satisfaction compared to others. This statement constitutes the first main finding of this study, thereby fully confirming hypothesis H2. Among all three variables, the effect on fear of death was the most pronounced. The difference in average scores between people who have never taken psychedelics and never had a complete mystical experience, and those who have taken psychedelics and had such an experience (26.61 points vs. 17.68 points) amounted to 8.93 points on a 43-point scale (21% of the scale). In the case of life satisfaction, the difference between the extreme groups with and without a full mystical experience was 3.24 points on a 31-point scale (11% of the scale), and in the case of empathy, it was 2.18 points on a 41-point scale (5% of the scale). The condition of a complete mystical experience also significantly increased the prediction for each of the three dependent variables compared to the condition of psychedelic use alone, which constitutes the second main finding of the study and fully confirms hypothesis H3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Psychedelic use is related to fear of death levels**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last main conclusion of the study is as follows: people who have consumed a classic psychedelic substance at least once in their life have significantly lower fear of death compared to others. This finding partially confirms hypothesis H1, which was not confirmed for the variables (1) overall emotional empathy and (2) life satisfaction. For these variables, no significant differences were obtained, but they tended to approach confirmation of the opposite hypotheses not established in the study – people who have taken a psychedelic substance at least once tended to have lower scores on the scales of life satisfaction and emotional empathy compared to others. However, these tendencies were not present in the case of empathy towards positive emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the study results, experiencing a complete mystical experience was associated with lower fear of death, higher life satisfaction, and a greater tendency to empathize with positive emotions. Mystical experiences significantly increased the predictive power of the studied variables compared to the psychedelic use only. It was observed that the use of these substances differentiated individuals in terms of fear of death, but only if they had not experienced a complete mystical experience. Those who had such an episode, exhibited consistent, relatively low levels of fear regardless of psychedelic use or lack thereof. Users of these substances showed a lower tendency to empathize with negative emotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was indicated that the connections with empathy and life satisfaction are independent and different between psychedelic use and complete mystical experiences. The separation of these associations, as well as indicating interaction effect in the case of fear of death, could be an indirect but valuable contribution to the debate on the therapeutic potential of substances that induce mystical experiences. Although the available experimental studies correspond quite well with the results presented here, these results do not allow for the confirmation of causal relationships. To establish these, longitudinal studies with a corresponding methodological design are needed in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The presented study is arguably the first measurement of the described variables conducted on a Polish sample in the context of mystical experiences and psychedelic use."
